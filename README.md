# ft_transcendence

## Description

A browser-based multiplayer Ludo platform. Players register or sign in through an external
provider, join a lobby, and play server-authoritative matches against remote opponents, a
local hotseat partner, or an AI. Results feed a persistent profile, a leaderboard, and an
achievement system, and the whole interface is available in multiple languages.

### Key features

- **Server-authoritative Ludo** — dice rolls, turn order, captures, safe squares and home
  entry are all resolved on the server; the client renders, it does not decide
- **Match formats** — Hotseat mode, vs Bot/AI (PVE) mode, vs Multiplayer (PVP) mode
- **Real-time play** — WebSocket transport with live board updates, presence, and reconnect
- **User management** — profiles, avatars, friends, live online status
- **Authentication** — local accounts, OAuth 2.0 sign-in (Google, GitHub, 42), email verification, and two-factor authentication (email code)
- **Progression** — match history, statistics, leaderboard, and achievements
- **Multilingual UI** — English, Malay, and French
- **Notifications, game customization, and extended browser support**

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (the only runtime requirement).
- **make** (to use the provided build commands).
- A `.env` file at the repo root (see [Configuration (.env)](#configuration-env) below). The stack refuses to start if required values are missing.
- OAuth client IDs and secrets for Google, GitHub, and 42 — **optional**. Local sign-up and login work without them.
- At least one free port: `8443` (HTTPS). Ports `3000`, `3001`, `5432`, `5555`, `6479` are used inside/for debugging.

### Running

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JaxzTan/ft_transcendence.git
cd ft_transcendence
make
```

`make` builds the images and starts the stack (the `make env` step it runs first validates the `.env` values). Then open https://localhost:8443 in your browser — accept the self-signed certificate warning on first visit.

### Development mode (hot reload)

```bash
make dev
# App:   http://localhost:8080   (Vite dev server, auto-reloads on save)
# Prod:  https://localhost:8443  (still running alongside, via nginx)
```

**Hardening notes**

- **`8443` (nginx)** is the only intentionally public-facing port (published on all host interfaces). It runs **TLS 1.2/1.3 only** with a self-signed cert and **no plain-HTTP listener**, sets HSTS + security headers + a CSP, disables `server_tokens`, denies hidden-file access, and applies per-IP rate limits (login `5r/m`, auth `60r/m`, refresh `30r/m`, leaderboard `30r/m`) in front of the API.
- **`8080` (Vite)** exists only under the `dev` compose profile (`make dev`). It serves the SPA and proxies `/api` and `/socket.io` without TLS.
- **`3000` (backend)** is published loopback-only; clients reach it exclusively through nginx's `/api` proxy. Backend hardening: JWT auth in httpOnly cookies, bcrypt password hashes, class-validator on DTOs, and NestJS rate throttling. CORS is intentionally not enabled — every call the SPA makes is same-origin through nginx, so the backend emits no cross-origin headers.
- **`5555` (Prisma Studio)** is a raw database browser with no application-level authentication — its protection is the loopback-only binding plus the Postgres credentials. Used on the host only.
- **`/socket.io/`** is reachable only same-origin: over TLS via nginx (`wss://`) or through the Vite dev proxy — never on a raw `ws://` port. The engine validates the Socket.IO handshake JWT (game-scoped, with role/color) before the socket can join a room.
- **Infrastructure ports not listed** — Postgres (`127.0.0.1:5432`), Redis (`127.0.0.1:6479`) and the engine (`127.0.0.1:3001`) — are all published loopback-only. Redis requires a password, Postgres requires credentials, and cross-container traffic rides the private `transcendence_network`.

### Configuration (.env)

All config lives in the root `.env` (`KEY=VALUE` per line), loaded into containers via compose's `env_file:`. It is gitignored and shared between the team only (via Discord) — copy `.env.example` to start, then fill in the real values from a teammate. `make` validates it and **fails early** if `.env` is missing or any required field is empty. OAuth credentials are added manually from the provider consoles (Google, GitHub, 42).

| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| PostgreSQL | Durable data — users, friendships, match history, achievements           |
| Redis      | Live game state — board, dice, turn pointer, matchmaking queue, presence |

### Justification for major technical choices

**Why React + NestJS + PostgreSQL.** They are the stack the team is most comfortable with
and they are explicitly allowed by the subject (as opposed to, e.g., Django or Spring), so
the team could move fast and defend every choice in review.

**Why Redis alongside it.** A running match is high-frequency, short-lived state — board
position, current dice value, whose turn it is, who is queued for matchmaking. Writing that
to Postgres on every move would put transactional write load on the database for data that
becomes worthless the moment the game ends. Redis holds it in memory; only the durable
outcome — result, opponents, duration, rating delta — is written to Postgres. Redis also
backs the Socket.IO adapter so broadcasts reach every client regardless of which backend
instance holds the socket.

**Why a server-authoritative game loop.** The client never decides a dice value or validates
a move. Every action is a request the server accepts or rejects against its own copy of the
board, which is what makes the multiplayer and remote-player modules defensible rather than
merely functional.

**Why Socket.IO over plain WebSockets.** It provides automatic reconnection, rooms, and
broadcasting out of the box, which the live board, presence, and reconnect flows build on.

**Why Passport + JWT in httpOnly cookies + bcrypt.** Passport handles the OAuth 2.0 flows
for Google, GitHub, and 42, so the provider callbacks are handled by a well-known library.
Sessions use a short-lived JWT access token (15 minutes) stored in an httpOnly cookie, so
page scripts cannot read it and XSS cannot steal it. The refresh token (7 days) is stored
hashed in Redis and rotated on every use, so a leaked token stops working once it is reused,
and can be revoked on logout or password reset. Passwords are hashed with bcrypt, so a
database leak does not expose usable credentials.

**Why Prisma.** Prisma keeps the database schema in one place and generates a type-safe
client from it, so queries are checked at compile time and no SQL is written by hand. Schema
changes are kept as committed migrations, so the database can be recreated or upgraded
consistently on any machine.

## Individual Contributions

### `liyu-her`

- **Built:** Frontend/backend framework setup (React + NestJS); remote players module (cross-machine play with reconnect); multiple languages module (session-based language switching across English, Malay and French); frontend design and the revamp to frontend v2; user activity analytics dashboard;
- **Challenges:** As team lead, the main challenge was team management — balancing everyone's workload and morale while making sure each member could still learn from the project rather than just clearing tickets. Extracting all user-facing text and data out of the frontend so it could be translated, without breaking the pages being redesigned at the same time

### `bleow`

- **Built:** Real-time features (Socket.IO gateway with Redis adapter for cross-instance broadcast, live board updates, presence, reconnect); AI opponent (heuristic move selection, no external model); web-based game (server-authoritative Ludo — dice RNG, turn order, captures, safe squares, exact-count home entry); game statistics and match history (wins/losses, rating, leaderboard); gamification (achievements, badges, leaderboards); multiplayer module (four-seat, server-enforced turn order);
- **Challenges:** Debugging and smoothly integrating backend with frontend. Numerous small guards to include to patch problems. Timely and clear communication with team.

### `hang`

- **Built:** Standard user management module (profiles, avatar upload, friend requests, live online status); notification system module (real-time notifications on create, update and delete actions); frontend implementation
- **Challenges:** Balancing deadlines against wanting the frontend to be pixel-perfect

### `jow`

- **Built:** ORM setup (Prisma — schema, relations and committed migration history); remote authentication module (OAuth 2.0 sign-in via Google, GitHub, and 42 Intra); two-factor authentication module (email code verification); Ngrok tunneling for exposing the local stack, including a new auth setup to secure the tunnel.
- **Challenges:** Day-to-day database management and debugging OAuth provider integrations — tedious but constant work

### Use of AI

The team used **Claude** and **ChatGPT** during development, in the following areas:

- **Test planning** — deriving an evaluation test plan from the module list, then structuring
  it into per-module test cases and tracking execution against it.
- **Debugging** — narrowing down defects.
- **UI and styling**.
- **Documentation generation** — drafting, structuring, and refining project documentation, including
  the architecture overview, API reference, and the per-module docs under `docs/`.

No AI tool was used to generate a complete module or feature end to end; all generated
material was reviewed and adapted by the team member responsible for that area.
