# ft_transcendence

## Description

A browser-based multiplayer Ludo platform. Players register or sign in through an external
provider, join a lobby, and play server-authoritative matches against remote opponents, a
local hotseat partner, or an AI. Results feed a persistent profile, a leaderboard, and an
achievement system, and the whole interface is available in multiple languages.

### Key features

- **Server-authoritative Ludo** — dice rolls, turn order, captures, safe squares and home
  entry are all resolved on the server; the client renders, it does not decide
- **Match formats** — Hotseat mode, vs Bot/AI (PVE) mode, vs Multiplayer (PVP) mode
- **Real-time play** — WebSocket transport with live board updates, presence, and reconnect
- **User management** — profiles, avatars, friends, live online status
- **Authentication** — local accounts, OAuth 2.0 sign-in (Google, GitHub, 42), email verification, and two-factor authentication (email code)
- **Progression** — match history, statistics, leaderboard, and achievements
- **Multilingual UI** — English, Malay, and French
- **Notifications, file upload, game customization, and extended browser support**

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (the only runtime requirement).
- **make** (to use the provided build commands).
- A restored `secrets/` directory (see [Secrets](#secrets) below). The stack refuses to start if a required secret file is missing.
- OAuth client IDs and secrets for Google, GitHub, and 42 — **optional**. Local sign-up and login work without them.
- At least one free port: `8443` (HTTPS). Ports `3000`, `3001`, `5432`, `5555`, `6479` are used inside/for debugging.

### Running

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JaxzTan/ft_transcendence.git
cd ft_transcendence
make
```

`make` builds the images and starts the stack (required secrets are prepared automatically). Then open https://localhost:8443 in your browser — accept the self-signed certificate warning on first visit.

### Development mode (hot reload)

```bash
make dev
# App:   http://localhost:8080   (Vite dev server, auto-reloads on save)
# Prod:  https://localhost:8443  (still running alongside, via nginx)
```

### Access

| URL                       | What it is                                                      | Profile |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `https://localhost:8443`  | The app (via nginx)                                             | default |
| `http://localhost:8080`   | Vite dev server with hot reload                                 | dev     |
| `http://localhost:3000`   | Backend API (direct, host-only)                                 | default |
| `http://localhost:5555`   | Prisma Studio (database browser)                                | default |
| `wss://<host>/socket.io/` | Game engine connection (same-origin through nginx / Vite proxy) | default |

### Secrets

The project stores configuration in plain-text files under `secrets/`, one value per file, named after the variable in lowercase (for example `JWT_SECRET` → `secrets/jwt_secret.txt`). The directory is mounted read-only into the containers. **Never commit this folder to git** (it is already ignored).

- `make secrets` generates and seeds everything that can be derived.
- OAuth credentials must be obtained from the provider consoles (Google Cloud, GitHub, 42 intra) and placed manually.

| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| PostgreSQL | Durable data — users, friendships, match history, achievements           |
| Redis      | Live game state — board, dice, turn pointer, matchmaking queue, presence |

### Justification for major technical choices

**Why React + NestJS + PostgreSQL.** They are the stack the team is most comfortable with
and they are explicitly allowed by the subject (as opposed to, e.g., Django or Spring), so
the team could move fast and defend every choice in review.

**Why Redis alongside it.** A running match is high-frequency, short-lived state — board
position, current dice value, whose turn it is, who is queued for matchmaking. Writing that
to Postgres on every move would put transactional write load on the database for data that
becomes worthless the moment the game ends. Redis holds it in memory; only the durable
outcome — result, opponents, duration, rating delta — is written to Postgres. Redis also
backs the Socket.IO adapter so broadcasts reach every client regardless of which backend
instance holds the socket.

**Why a server-authoritative game loop.** The client never decides a dice value or validates
a move. Every action is a request the server accepts or rejects against its own copy of the
board, which is what makes the multiplayer and remote-player modules defensible rather than
merely functional.

**Why Socket.IO over plain WebSockets.** It provides automatic reconnection, rooms, and
broadcasting out of the box, which the live board, presence, and reconnect flows build on.

**Why Passport + JWT in httpOnly cookies + bcrypt.** Passport handles the OAuth 2.0 flows
for Google, GitHub, and 42, so the provider callbacks are handled by a well-known library.
Sessions use a short-lived JWT access token (15 minutes) stored in an httpOnly cookie, so
page scripts cannot read it and XSS cannot steal it. The refresh token (7 days) is stored
hashed in Redis and rotated on every use, so a leaked token stops working once it is reused,
and can be revoked on logout or password reset. Passwords are hashed with bcrypt, so a
database leak does not expose usable credentials.

**Why Prisma.** Prisma keeps the database schema in one place and generates a type-safe
client from it, so queries are checked at compile time and no SQL is written by hand. Schema
changes are kept as committed migrations, so the database can be recreated or upgraded
consistently on any machine.

### Use of AI

The team used **Claude** and **ChatGPT** during development, in the following areas:

- **Test planning** — deriving an evaluation test plan from the module list, then structuring
  it into per-module test cases and tracking execution against it.
- **Debugging** — narrowing down defects.
- **UI and styling**.
- **Documentation generation** — drafting, structuring, and refining project documentation, including  
  the architecture overview, API reference, and the per-module docs under `docs/`.

No AI tool was used to generate a complete module or feature end to end; all generated
material was reviewed and adapted by the team member responsible for that area.

## Known Limitations

- The self-signed certificate triggers a browser warning on first visit (expected — it is a local development setup).
- Ngrok's free tier shows an interstitial page for new visitors.
- Campus/corporate WiFi may block device-to-device traffic in LAN mode (use a phone hotspot to test).
