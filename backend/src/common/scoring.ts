// Points awarded for one game: each piece that reached the goal scores
// POINTS_PER_PIECE (halved for PvE), plus a bonus piece for the winner.
// ratingDeltaFor() converts a finished game's result into a rating delta.
//
// Users:
// - Match post-game (match.postgame.service.ts): after a real match ends it
//   computes each human player's delta via ratingDeltaFor() and applies it to
//   User.rating (bots are skipped, so they never get rating changes).
// - User (user.service.ts): when it serves a profile / game history it derives
//   the same per-game `ratingDelta` so clients can show how much a match moved
//   the rating.
//
// The two constants are only read by ratingDeltaFor() — nothing imports
// POINTS_PER_PIECE / WIN_BONUS_PIECE directly.
