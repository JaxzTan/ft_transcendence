## Overview

The ludo-engine exposes a Socket.IO server on port 3001. All game communication happens through events. The engine requires JWT authentication in the handshake `auth` object.

The server is started by `index.ts` which calls `SocketServer.start(3001)`. The `SocketServer` class in `socket/server.ts` registers all event handlers and manages the `engine` (game state machine) and `redisGameStore` (persistence).

---

## Quick Reference

Every socket event at a glance — direction, what triggers it, and its
input/output. Each event is documented in full below; see
[Event Reference](#event-reference) for the complete payload schemas.

### Client → Server

| Event | Triggered by | Payload (client → server) | Server action | Resulting broadcasts |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `join_game` | Entering a room — PvP join/rejoin, PvE/hotseat seat-in (hotseat sends one call per local seat) | `(gameId: string, playerColor?, userId?, displayName?)` | Bind the socket to the room/seat (reconnect or fresh join), create the game if missing, auto-start PvE/hotseat | `game_joined` to the sender |
| `roll_dice` | Current player, phase `WAITING_FOR_ROLL` | `()` | Roll the die and compute the legal moves (a 3rd six auto-forfeits the turn) | `dice_rolled` |
| `move_piece` | Current player, phase `WAITING_FOR_MOVE` | `(pieceId: string)` | Validate and apply the move | `piece_moved` |
| `player_ready` | Seated player in the waiting lobby | `()` | Mark ready; when every active player is ready the game starts | `game_started` |
| `select_color` | Seated player during color selection | `(color: 'red'/'green'/'yellow'/'blue')` | Move the player to the requested seat color | `color_selected` + `lobby_update` |
| `leave_game` | Player leaving a room (e.g. after a match) | `()` | Mark the seat exited, clear its pieces, advance the turn | `player_exited` |
| `resign` | Player forfeiting an active match | `()` | Record the resignation as a loss and finish the player | `player_resigned` (+ `game_ended` if no active players remain) |
| `end_game` | Host presses "End Game" | `()` | PvE/hotseat: abort the whole game. PvP: prune this player, abort the room if fewer than 2 humans remain | `game_expired` or `player_aborted` |
| `disconnect` | Socket drops (automatic) | — | Start the reconnect grace period | `player_disconnected`, then `player_reconnected` or `player_exited` |

### Server → Client

| Event | Triggered by | Payload (server → client) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `game_joined` | A successful `join_game` | `GameState` | Sent to the joining socket only |
| `dice_rolled` | A die roll | `{ value, legalMoves, bonusRoll, currentTurn, forfeited? }` | Room-wide |
| `piece_moved` | A legal move applied | `MoveResult` | Room-wide |
| `game_started` | All players ready / PvE or hotseat auto-start | `{ gameId }` | Room-wide |
| `game_ended` | A match finishes (all pieces home / forfeit / resignation) | `{ winner, resultDetail }` | Room-wide |
| `game_timeout` | 60 s after `game_ended` — the finished room is torn down | — | Room-wide |
| `game_expired` | Idle lobby expired (5 min, < 2 seated) or a bot-mode abort | — | Room-wide |
| `player_exited` | Permanent exit — leaving the room or disconnect grace expired (not a resignation) | `{ color }` | Room-wide |
| `player_resigned` | A player resigned / conceded the match | `{ color }` | Room-wide |
| `player_aborted` | Host ended a PvP game / room aborted | `{ color, username }` | Room-wide |
| `player_disconnected` | A socket dropped (temporary) | `{ color }` | Room-wide |
| `player_reconnected` | Reconnect inside the grace window | `{ color }` | Room-wide |
| `lobby_update` | Lobby seats / ready state changed | `{ players: [{ userId, username, avatarStyle, color, ready }] }` | Room-wide |
| `color_selected` | A seat color change | `{ gameId, userId, color }` | Room-wide |
| `state_update` | Any Redis pub/sub frame | `any` (parsed JSON) | Catch-all the SPA falls back to |
| `error` | Invalid action / failed authentication | `string` | Sent to the offending socket |

## Files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `index.ts` | Entry point — `SocketServer.start(3001)` |
| `socket/server.ts` | `SocketServer` class — event routing, JWT middleware, engine lifecycle |
| `socket/auth.ts` | `GameSocket` type, JWT extraction middleware |
| `socket/socket-handlers.ts` | All client→server event handlers (join, roll, move, etc.) |
| `socket/event-publisher.ts` | Redis pub/sub → Socket.IO bridge for multi-instance scaling |
| `socket/redis-broadcaster.ts` | Room-based state broadcasts via Redis |
| `socket/result-submitter.ts` | POST /api/game/end callback to backend |

---

## Connection

### Handshake

Connect to the engine with a JWT token in the `auth` object. The browser connects to its **own origin** (`/socket.io/`), which nginx (or the Vite proxy) forwards to the engine:

```js
const io = require('socket.io-client');
const socket = io(window.location.origin, {   // same-origin → nginx → ludo-engine
  auth: { token: '<jwt-from-match-endpoint>' },
  transports: ['websocket'],
});
```

The JWT payload (issued by `MatchService`) contains:

```json
{
  "gameId": "uuid",
  "playerId": "user-id",
  "username": "username",
  "displayName": "Display Name",
  "role": "player1" | "player",
  "mode": "pvp" | "pve" | "hotseat"
}
```

### JWT Validation

The `socket/auth.ts` middleware reads the token from `socket.handshake.auth.token` and verifies it with a minimal HMAC-SHA256 check (no external JWT library). It maps `playerId`/`sub`/`userId` to `socket.data.userId`, and attaches `role`, `gameId`, `username`, and `displayName` to `socket.data`. Invalid or missing tokens are rejected with an `error` event.

### Connection flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Player
    participant Engine as LudoEngine (socket server)

    Player->>Engine: Connect with the game token
    Engine->>Engine: Check the token is valid
    Player->>Engine: join_game (gameId, color)
    Engine-->>Player: game_joined (the board state)
    Player->>Engine: roll_dice
    Engine-->>Player: dice_rolled (value + movable pieces)
    Player->>Engine: move_piece (pieceId)
    Engine-->>Player: piece_moved
    Engine-->>Player: game_ended (if someone won)
```

### Rooms

- Each game has a room named `game:{gameId}`.
- Players join the room via `join_game`.
- Server broadcasts to a room using `io.to(room).emit(...)`.

---

## Client → Server Events

### `join_game`

Join or create a game room.

```js
socket.emit('join_game', gameId, playerColor, userId?, displayName?);
```

| Param | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `gameId` | string | Match UUID |
| `playerColor` | `'red'` \| `'green'` \| `'yellow'` \| `'blue'` | Your chosen color |
| `userId` | string | (optional) Override for bots |
| `displayName` | string | (optional) Display name for the seat |

**Response:** `game_joined` event with full `GameState`

**Errors:** `error` event with message.

---

### `end_game`

End the game prematurely (host/admin action).

```js
socket.emit('end_game');
```

**Response:** `game_ended` / `player_aborted` broadcast.

---

### `roll_dice`

Roll the dice for the current turn.

```js
socket.emit('roll_dice');
```

**Response:** `dice_rolled` event (broadcast to all in room)

**Errors:** `error` if not your turn, wrong phase, or player exited.

---

### `move_piece`

Move a piece using a legal pieceId.

```js
socket.emit('move_piece', pieceId);
```

| Param | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `pieceId` | string | e.g. `"red-0"` |

**Response:** `piece_moved` event (broadcast to all in room)

**Errors:** `error` if piece not in current legal moves.

---

### `player_ready`

Signal that the current player is ready to start the game.

```js
socket.emit('player_ready');
```

**Response:** None

---

### `select_color`

Select a color for the player (used during lobby/color selection phase).

```js
socket.emit('select_color', color);
```

| Param | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `color` | string | e.g. `"red"` |

**Response:** None

---

### `leave_game`

Leave the current game (acknowledges leaving after game has ended).

```js
socket.emit('leave_game');
```

**Response:** None

---

### `resign`

Forfeit the game voluntarily.

```js
socket.emit('resign');
```

**Response:** `player_resigned` event (broadcast to all). If the resignation ends the match (no other active players remain), `game_ended` follows.

---

### `disconnect`

Automatically handled by Socket.IO on connection drop.

```js
// No manual emit needed — Socket.IO handles this
```

**Response:** `player_disconnected` is broadcast immediately; `player_reconnected` fires if the player returns inside the grace window; `player_exited` (and possible room teardown) only if the grace window expires without a reconnect.
