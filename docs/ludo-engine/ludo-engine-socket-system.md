## Overview

The ludo-engine exposes a Socket.IO server on port 3001. All game communication happens through events. The engine requires JWT authentication in the handshake `auth` object.

The server is started by `index.ts` which calls `SocketServer.start(3001)`. The `SocketServer` class in `socket/server.ts` is the orchestration root: it wires the engine (game state machine) and Redis store, then routes engine events and socket events to the dedicated modules (`SocketHandlers`, `JoinManager`, `BotTurnScheduler`, `PostGameManager`).

---

## Files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `index.ts` | Entry point — `SocketServer.start(3001)` |
| `socket/server.ts` | `SocketServer` — composition root: engine wiring, JWT middleware, engine-event routing, socket wiring |
| `socket/auth.ts` | `GameSocket` type, JWT extraction middleware |
| `socket/socket-handlers.ts` | `SocketHandlers` — client→server gameplay/lobby/lifecycle handlers; delegates `join_game` to `JoinManager` |
| `socket/join-manager.ts` | `JoinManager` — the `join_game` flow (seat resolution, game creation, reconnects, auto-start, resume) |
| `socket/bot-scheduler.ts` | `BotTurnScheduler` — bot turn timers + clash-freeze gating |
| `socket/post-game.ts` | `PostGameManager` — post-game timeout, rematch voting, `end_game` |
| `socket/event-publisher.ts` | Redis pub/sub → Socket.IO bridge for multi-instance scaling |
| `socket/redis-broadcaster.ts` | Room-based state broadcasts via Redis |
| `socket/result-submitter.ts` | POST /api/game/end callback to backend |

---

## Connection

### Handshake

Connect to the engine with a JWT token in the `auth` object. The browser connects to its **own origin** (`/socket.io/`), which nginx (or the Vite proxy) forwards to the engine:

```js
const io = require('socket.io-client');
const socket = io(window.location.origin, {   // same-origin → nginx → ludo-engine
  auth: { token: '<jwt-from-match-endpoint>' },
  transports: ['websocket'],
});
```

The JWT payload (issued by `MatchService`) contains:

```json
{
  "gameId": "uuid",
  "playerId": "user-id",
  "username": "username",
  "displayName": "Display Name",
  "role": "player1" | "player",
  "mode": "pvp" | "pve" | "hotseat"
}
```

### JWT Validation

The `socket/auth.ts` middleware reads the token from `socket.handshake.auth.token` and verifies it with a minimal HMAC-SHA256 check (no external JWT library). It maps `playerId`/`sub`/`userId` to `socket.data.userId`, and attaches `role`, `gameId`, `username`, and `displayName` to `socket.data`. Invalid or missing tokens are rejected with an `error` event.

### Connection flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Player
    participant Engine as LudoEngine (socket server)

    Player->>Engine: Connect with the game token
    Engine->>Engine: Check the token is valid
    Player->>Engine: join_game (gameId, color)
    Engine-->>Player: game_joined (the board state)
    Player->>Engine: roll_dice
    Engine-->>Player: dice_rolled (value + movable pieces)
    Player->>Engine: move_piece (pieceId)
    Engine-->>Player: piece_moved
    Engine-->>Player: game_ended (if someone won)
```

### Rooms

- Each game has a room named `game:{gameId}`.
- Players join the room via `join_game`.
- Server broadcasts to a room using `io.to(room).emit(...)`.

---

## Client → Server Events

### `join_game`

Join or create a game room.

```js
socket.emit('join_game', gameId, playerColor, userId?, displayName?);
```

| Param | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `gameId` | string | Match UUID |
| `playerColor` | `'red'` \| `'green'` \| `'yellow'` \| `'blue'` | Your chosen color |
| `userId` | string | (optional) Override for bots |
| `displayName` | string | (optional) Display name for the seat |

**Response:** `game_joined` event with full `GameState`

**Errors:** `error` event with message.

---

### `end_game`

End the game prematurely (host/admin action).

```js
socket.emit('end_game');
```

**Response:** `game_ended` / `player_aborted` broadcast.

---

### `roll_dice`

Roll the dice for the current turn.

```js
socket.emit('roll_dice');
```

**Response:** `dice_rolled` event (broadcast to all in room)

**Errors:** `error` if not your turn, wrong phase, or player exited.

---

### `move_piece`

Move a piece using a legal pieceId.

```js
socket.emit('move_piece', pieceId);
```

| Param | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `pieceId` | string | e.g. `"red-0"` |

**Response:** `piece_moved` event (broadcast to all in room)

**Errors:** `error` if piece not in current legal moves.

---

### `player_ready`

Signal that the current player is ready to start the game.

```js
socket.emit('player_ready');
```

**Response:** None

---

### `select_color`

Select a color for the player (used during lobby/color selection phase).

```js
socket.emit('select_color', color);
```

| Param | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `color` | string | e.g. `"red"` |

**Response:** None

---

### `leave_game`

Leave the current game (acknowledges leaving after game has ended).

```js
socket.emit('leave_game');
```

**Response:** None

---

### `resign`

Forfeit the game voluntarily.

```js
socket.emit('resign');
```

**Response:** `player_exited` event (broadcast to all)

---

### `rematch`

Vote for a rematch after the game has ended. At least 2 votes required.

```js
socket.emit('rematch');
```

**Response:** `game_created` event with new `gameId` (when quorum reached), or `game_timeout`.

---

### `exit_post_game`

Acknowledge the end of a game and leave the post-game lobby.

```js
socket.emit('exit_post_game');
```

**Response:** None. May trigger `game_timeout` if quorum is broken.

---

### `disconnect`

Automatically handled by Socket.IO on connection drop.

```js
// No manual emit needed — Socket.IO handles this
```

**Response:** `player_exited` event (broadcast)

---
