## Overview

The User module manages public user profiles, game history, and avatar images.

1. **Public profile** — `GET /api/user/:username` returns profile stats.
2. **Game history** — `GET /api/user/:username/games` returns paginated past games.
3. **Avatar upload** — `POST /api/user/avatar` accepts a multipart image (max 2 MB, PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP).
4. **Avatar retrieval** — `GET /api/user/id/:userId/avatar` returns the binary image (keyed by the immutable user id, so a rename cannot break it).
5. **Avatar deletion** — `DELETE /api/user/avatar` removes the custom avatar.

> The avatar pipeline — where the bytes live, the shared Redis record the engine reads, the caching
> and freshness rules, and how a failed load is handled — is described in full in
> [`avatar-system.md`](../avatar-system.md).

## Core Logic / Flow

### 1. Get Public Profile

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Site as Your App
    participant Server as Backend
    participant DB as Database

    User->>Site: Open someone's profile page
    Site->>Server: GET /api/user/{username}
    Server->>DB: Look up that player
    alt Player not found
        Server-->>Site: 404 Not found
        Site-->>User: Show "player not found"
    else Found
        Server-->>Site: Public profile (rating, stats, no password)
        Site-->>User: Show the profile page
    end
```

### 2. Get Game History

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Site as Your App
    participant Server as Backend
    participant DB as Database

    User->>Site: Scroll to the match history section
    Site->>Server: GET /api/user/{username}/games?page=1&limit=20
    Server->>DB: Load that player's finished games
    DB-->>Server: Game history
    Server-->>Site: One page of games + page info
    Site-->>User: Show the game history list
```

### 3. Upload Avatar

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Site as Your App
    participant Server as Backend

    User->>Site: Pick a new avatar picture
    Site->>Server: POST /api/user/avatar (upload the image)
    Server->>Server: Check the size, the declared type and the actual image bytes
    Server->>Server: Save the picture on the profile, then update the shared avatar record
    Server-->>Site: "Avatar uploaded"
    Site-->>User: Show the new avatar
```

### 4. Get Avatar

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Site as Your App
    participant Server as Backend

    User->>Site: Open a page that shows avatars
    alt No photo known (hasAvatarPhoto is not true)
        Site->>Site: Render the DiceBear default — no request, no 404
    else Has an avatar
        Site->>Server: GET /api/user/id/{userId}/avatar, plus ?v=stamp once a change is known
        Server-->>Site: The image file
        Site-->>User: Show the picture
    end
```

### 5. Delete Avatar

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Site as Your App
    participant Server as Backend

    User->>Site: Click "Remove my avatar"
    Site->>Server: DELETE /api/user/avatar
    Server->>Server: Delete the saved picture, then set has: false in the shared record
    Server-->>Site: "Avatar deleted"
    Site->>Site: Set hasAvatarPhoto = false
    Site-->>User: Show the default avatar again (no photo request)
```

## Logic Paths Summary

### Get Public Profile Path
```
GET /api/user/:username
  ├── user.findUnique({ username })
  │   ├── null → 404
  │   └── found → return profile (exclude password_hash)
```

### Get Game History Path
```
GET /api/user/:username/games?page=&limit=
  ├── gameParticipant.findMany({ where: { user: { username } }, include: [game, user] })
  ├── Map to GameHistoryItem[] (each includes gameType, rank, piecesCaptured,
  │   piecesInGoal, ratingDelta, participants with avatarStyle from user)
  └── Return { games, pagination: { page, limit, total, totalPages } }
```

### Upload Avatar Path
```
POST /api/user/avatar (JWT)
  ├── FileInterceptor('avatar') — max 2MB, allowed: png/jpeg/gif/webp
  ├── user.update({ avatarPhoto: buffer, avatarPhotoContentType: mime })
  └── 200 { message: 'Avatar uploaded', contentType }
```

### Get Avatar Path
```
GET /api/user/id/:userId/avatar
  ├── getAvatarById(userId) via User.avatarPhoto
  │   ├── null → 404 (Cache-Control: no-store, so it is never cached)
  │   └── found → res.set(Content-Type), send binary
  │              (Cache-Control: public, no-cache, no-transform + ETag)
  └── Note: the base URL is stable (Express answers 304 when the bytes are
      unchanged). After a change the client appends `?v=<stamp>` : a
      byte-identical URL can otherwise be served from the browser's in-memory
      image cache with no request at all, so `no-cache` alone never revalidates.
  └── Note: a client only calls this route when it knows a photo exists
      (AvatarMetaService's Redis record, surfaced in payloads and in the
      engine's PlayerMeta), so a photo-less user produces no 404 at all.
```

### Avatar Metadata Cache (AvatarMetaService)
```
avatar:<userId>  →  { has: '0'|'1', style: '<dicebear style>', v: '<epoch ms>' }

  ├── Written AFTER the Postgres write in register / OAuth-create / upload /
  │   delete (Redis-first could leave has=1 with no bytes → a guaranteed 404).
  ├── Read by the ludo-engine, which has no database access of its own, at
  │   join time : that is how a seat knows whether its player has a photo.
  ├── Repaired from Postgres on /me and public-profile reads (syncFromUser),
  │   so a missed write or an eviction converges instead of drifting.
  └── Redis is a cache, never the truth : a miss means has=false, and Postgres
      stays authoritative for the bytes.
```

### Delete Avatar Path
```
DELETE /api/user/avatar (JWT)
  ├── user.update({ avatarPhoto: null, avatarPhotoContentType: null })
  └── 200 { message: 'Avatar deleted' }
```
