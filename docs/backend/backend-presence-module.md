## Overview

The Presence module tracks whether a user is currently online, offline, or playing. It stores each user's status in Redis with a short time-to-live (TTL), so a stale entry disappears on its own when a client stops sending heartbeats (for example, after a browser crash or network drop).

The module provides:

1. **Heartbeat** — a client sends `POST /api/presence/heartbeat` every ~20 seconds while the app is open.
2. **Playing flag** — the same endpoint accepts an optional `playing` boolean to advertise "playing" instead of "online" while inside a match.
3. **Clear** — a client calls `DELETE /api/presence/heartbeat` on logout to read as offline immediately instead of waiting out the TTL.

## Key Types / Interfaces

### HeartbeatDto

```typescript
class HeartbeatDto {
  playing?: boolean;  // When true, status reads as "playing" instead of "online"
}
```

### Presence Status Values

Presence is a runtime Redis concept, not a database enum. `PresenceStatus` is a TypeScript type alias:

```typescript
export type PresenceStatus = 'online' | 'playing' | 'offline';
```

A missing Redis presence key *is* the offline state. The heartbeat TTL (45s, covering two missed ~20s beats) expires stale entries automatically.

## API Endpoints

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/api/presence/heartbeat` | JWT | Send presence heartbeat (with optional `playing` flag) |
| `DELETE` | `/api/presence/heartbeat` | JWT | Clear presence (logout) |

## Core Logic / Flow

### 1. Heartbeat

Sequence of steps when a client sends a presence heartbeat.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Site as Your App
    participant Server as Backend

    loop Every ~30 seconds while the page is open
        User->>Site: Page heartbeat
        Site->>Server: POST /api/presence/heartbeat { playing: true|false }
        Server->>Server: Save "online" (or "playing") for 45 seconds
    end
```

### 2. Clear Presence

Sequence of steps when a user logs out.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Site as Your App
    participant Server as Backend

    User->>Site: Close the page / log out
    Site->>Server: DELETE /api/presence/heartbeat
    Server->>Server: Mark the user offline
```

## Logic Paths Summary

### Heartbeat Path
```
POST /api/presence/heartbeat (JWT required)
  ├── Set presence:{userId} with TTL
  │   ├── playing=true → status 'playing'
  │   └── playing=false → status 'online'
  └── 200 { ok: true }
```

### Clear Path
```
DELETE /api/presence/heartbeat (JWT required)
  ├── Delete presence:{userId} from Redis
  └── 200 { ok: true }
```

## Additional Service Methods

The `PresenceService` also provides read methods used by other parts of the application:

| Method | Signature | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| `getStatus` | `getStatus(userId: string): Promise<PresenceStatus>` | Single-user lookup — e.g. profile pages |
| `getStatuses` | `getStatuses(userIds: string[]): Promise<Record<string, PresenceStatus>>` | Batched lookup for friends lists |

`PresenceStatus` is a type alias: `'online' | 'playing' | 'offline'`. A missing Redis key *is* the offline state — the TTL handles cleanup automatically.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `Redis` (ioredis) | Presence state store with 45s TTL |
| `JwtAuthGuard` | Protects both heartbeat endpoints |

---

## Configuration / Environment

| Variable | Default | Used By |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `REDIS_HOST` | `redis` | Redis host for presence state |
| `REDIS_PORT` | `6479` | Redis port |
| `REDIS_PASSWORD` | (from secrets) | Redis password |
